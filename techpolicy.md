# Technology Policy
tl;dr: Technology is amazing! It is also distracting. Please be mindful of your technology use, stay present in the class, and refrain from using your laptop or tablet for any non-class-related activities while in class.

longer version:
We now have the [attention spans of goldfish](https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/).  I believe that laptops, cell phones, and other electronic devices largely serve as an irritant and a distraction from classroom discussion.  

Students who are texting or using a phone during class will be asked to leave.
