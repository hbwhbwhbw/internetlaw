# FAQ
1. **Do I need a tech background to take this class?**
Absolutely not. Anyone can take this class, which focuses on the law and governance of the Internet. I promise the class requires no technical knowledge beyond what's assigned in the syllabus.

Please bring your laptop, the casebook, and any notes you need. You may want to take a look at the [technology policy] for the class.

Readings for this class will be posted on Canvas. The reading assignments can be found [here](https://hbwhbwhbw.github.io/internetlaw/2020Fall_InternetLaw_Readings).

3a. **OMG, that's a lot of reading...** Yes. This class does require a fair amount of reading.

4. **I don't feel well. What should I do?**
First, I hope you feel better soon! Second, please don't come to class. If you feel up to it, you can participate remotely.

6. **What's your attendance policy?** Life happens. I understand. Prompt and regular attendance is important to the classroom community.

Pursuant to the law school's policy, missing more than 25 percent of the class meetings will lead you to be automatically withdrawn from the course.
