### Optional
On certain class days, I have supplied optional readings or resources. These are truly optional, but they provide some perspective, background, or interpretation that I find interesting or helpful.

## Readings

A note on the readings: We'll encounter a wide range of legal documents, including not just judicial opinions but also domestic and foreign statutes, administrative rulings, and legal briefs. We will also be reading book excerpts, as well as legal and social science scholarship. There is a massive body of legal, social, political, and economic research concerning the Internet; this course aims to give you a taste of how perspectives from non-lawyers may also influence debates within Internet law itself.
